  <p>NurseConnect is a National Department of Health (NDoH) initiative. It is the one stop shop where nurses can find information, ask for expert help, receive emotional support and have a line of direct communication with the National Department of Health. It utilises mobile software to give nurses in South Africa access to clinical, psychosocial and learning content. </p>

  <p>NurseConnect sends messages over WhatsApp and SMS to help nurses with the important work they do. The NurseConnect mobisite, nurseconnect.org, offers a content repository that can be accessed by nurses at any time. There is also a NurseConnect Helpdesk. Nurses can reply to any NurseConnect message over WhatsApp or SMS with a question and a professional will reply. </p>
